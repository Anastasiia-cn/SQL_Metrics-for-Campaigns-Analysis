In my SQL project, I successfully computed various essential metrics for campaign analysis. Specifically, I calculated the total expenses, number of impressions, clicks, and the total value of conversions on the corresponding date for each campaign. Additionally, I derived metrics such as Click-Through Rate (CTR), Cost Per Click (CPC), Cost Per Mille (CPM), and Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) for the relevant date and campaign. Furthermore, for each utm_campaign in every month I calculated the CPM, CTR and ROMI percentage difference between the current month and the previous one.
